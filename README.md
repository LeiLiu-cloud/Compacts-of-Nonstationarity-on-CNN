# Compacts-of-Nonstationarity-on-CNN
* calculate training data though SGS method
* build CNN model to predict the variogram parameters
* evalaute impacts of 3 typical types of spatial nonstationarity on CNN prediction performance: 
  * large relative variogram range-related nonstationarity
  * additive trend and residual-related nonstationarity
  * mixture population-related nonstationarity
